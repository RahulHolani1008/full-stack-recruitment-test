# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
### A) If given more time and information about the project, I would work on creating smaller components for reusability in the future

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
### A) I am most proud of the way I retrieved and handled data from the flights.json file as it is extremely well written.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
### A) I spent the most time with handling the data from flights.json and finding the mot efficient way of retrieving it.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
### A) I honestly had a lot of fun! I would like to take part in several other activities like this one! No, I didn't have any issues completing the test. I would suggest for the test to have a child-parent relationship between components and ask us how to pass data amongst one another as that is something many people struggle with.
